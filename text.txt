Our project is geared toward children's education, and we want to take it to the next level.Â 

Based on a case study and our own views, 
we researched that there was a significant
decrease in the average primary school gpa following the lockdown in Europe.

The foundation of our solution is a very popular and powerful teaching method called Suggestopedia.
It could boost people's abilities to learn three times faster and more efficiently.

We will enhance this method by creating a platform that will work as a
 hub for different virtual reality providers and their products.

We plan a number of innovations, like game-oriented environments, etc.
