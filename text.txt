I am thrilled to present you with our education project called learning journey.

it is geared toward children's education, and we want to take it to the next level.
We will centralize and unite high-tech education products. 

Based on a case study and our own views, 
we researched that there was a significant
decrease in the average primary school gpa following the lockdown in Europe.

The foundation of our solution is a very popular and powerful teaching method called Suggestopedia.
It could boost people's abilities to learn three times faster and more efficiently.

We will enhance this method by creating a platform that will work as a
 hub for different virtual reality providers and their products.

We plan a number of innovations, like game-oriented environments, etc.
